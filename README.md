**Objective**

Same says climate change is the biggest threat of our age while others say it&#39;s a myth based on dodgy science.

Understanding the change in temperature over last 100-150 years by country and city will give us some in-sights about global warming. If possible find any correlation between temperature and CO2 in the atmosphere.

Hopefully visualization of these valuable data by government agency will help us identify our findings and trends.
